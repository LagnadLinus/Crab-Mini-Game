**Crab Mini Game ðŸ¦€**

This is a simple mini-game built using Python and the Turtle graphics library, where players control a crab to complete an objective.

**Project Overview**

The Crab Mini Game requires the player to guide a crab from land to the sea, simulating its journey to reach the ocean for breeding. The game is controlled via the keyboard, using the arrow keys to move the crab in all four directions.

**Game Objectives**

**Creating the Crab:** The game features a crab that moves in multiple directions using the up, down, left, and right arrow keys.
Objective: The crab starts on land, and the goal is to guide it to the sea.
Completion Message: When the crab successfully reaches the sea, the player receives a message: "Player Won !!"
Design

**Diagram:** The crab, represented in blue, begins on land (orange) and must reach the sea (blue).
Flowchart: Visualizes the flow of gameplay and objective.
Pseudocode: Lays out the logic used to implement movement and objectives.

**Implementation**
The game logic and code are available in crab_mini_game.py and final_crab_mini_game.py. The goto() function is used to draw and fill the sea area, marking it as the finish point for the crab.

**Evaluation**
This project successfully allows the crab to move in all four directions to complete the objective, displaying a "Crab Won" message upon reaching the sea.
